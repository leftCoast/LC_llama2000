This library is in EARLY development. So don't go thinking it's going to help you very much. It's only pinned here so those that are involved can find it easly.

4/6/2025 : Well, it looks like it finally works. And, has what I've deemed to be the minimum functionality. I've shifted from 24/7 hacking at the poor thing while experimenting with new profanity, to just using it. I've been really happy with how stable it's been so far.

7/7/2025 : Today I dropped off the first complete device, based on this code, to be installed on a "real" boat. (Mine) It'll be intesting to see how this fares out in the field. A custom replacement engine control panel with NMEA200 interface built in. Controls the Tach. broadcasts the engine RPM. Monitors the coolant tempature and oil pressure and broadcasts these alarms down the wire as well. There is also a NMEA2000 fuel gauge on the panel. This will only work if the code added from here doesn't screw up the network.

NOTE : These source files were written with 3 space tabs. If they look like mashed up gibberish, you'll need to set up your system to vew them like that.
